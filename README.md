# EESTech-Challenge-2022

Python code written during the **EESTech Challenge Patras Local Round** 12-hour hackathon.

## Topic:

The topic of the hackathon was Machine Learning, more specifically Text Classification.
The given dataset was [20 Newsgroups](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html) and we were prompted to mainly use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

## Code:

Our code was divided into 4 parts:

##### 1. Import of packages
##### 2. Definition of custom functions
##### 3. Loading, cleaning and preprocessing of data
##### 4. Model training and evaluation

## Participants:
#### Team Name : Machine Forgetting
#### Members : [@AntonisPar](https://github.com/AntonisPar), [@iamtsac](https://github.com/iamtsac), [@jpavlakis](https://github.com/jpavlakis)
